In [Lyn Alden](https://x.com/LynAldenContact)'s latest book, "Broken Money: How Our Financial System is Failing Us,"  provides a comprehensive analysis of the origins, evolution, and current state of our financial system. Drawing on historical context, Alden explains how money has transformed from a simple medium of exchange to a complex system intertwined with global economies and politics.

The book delves into the reasons behind the perceived failure of the current monetary system, highlighting issues such as inflation, debt cycles, and the loss of purchasing power. Alden argues that these problems stem from the system's departure from money's traditional roles, acting as both a commodity and a credit.

One of the most compelling parts of "Broken Money" is its discussion on Bitcoin. Alden describes Bitcoin as the emergence of open source money, which embodies the properties of a perfect ledger: decentralized, transparent, and immutable. She posits that Bitcoin represents a return to the original principles of money, offering a potential solution to the systemic issues plaguing our financial system.

"Broken Money" is not just a critique of the current financial system but also a call to action. It encourages readers to rethink their understanding of money, its history, and its future. By exploring the rise of Bitcoin and the concept of money as a ledger with both commodity and credit properties, Alden offers a hopeful perspective on how we can address the financial system's shortcomings.
