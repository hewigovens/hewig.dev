Saying goodbye is bittersweet, I hold dear the recollections and wisdom gleaned during my time at TW. The Japanese concept of `Ikigai`, which means a reason for being, resonates profoundly with the state of fulfillment and purpose I experienced throughout these years.

However, I have realized that our lives are punctuated by distinct periods, each with its own unique focus. While my health and well-being now demand a different pace, I will forever value the lessons I have learned from this experience:

- The transformative power of building something from the ground up
- The resilience required to handle critical vulnerabilities
- The importance of witnessing and contributing to team growth
- The unwavering belief in our principles
- The comprehensive understanding of crypto across all stacks

I am eternally grateful for the opportunity to have been part of this extraordinary team. Your support and camaraderie have made this journey unforgettable.

As I venture into the unknown, I will carry with me the lessons and experiences that have shaped me here. I wish you all continued success and fulfillment in your endeavors.
