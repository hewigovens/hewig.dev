VMWare Fusion/Workstation Pro is free for personal use.

There aren't many free virtual machine options for Apple M series Macs, I was using [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) for a while, now check out this [announcement]([https://www.vmware.com/news/2021/04/free-virtual-machines-for-apple-m-series-macs.html) from VMWare.

> Pro Apps are now Free for Personal Use and Licensed for Commercial Use

I extracted the download links here:

- [VMware Fusion Pro Download](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productdownloads?subfamily=VMware%20Fusion&freeDownloads=true)
- [VMware Workstation Pro Download](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productdownloads?subfamily=VMware%20Workstation%20Pro&freeDownloads=true)

All you need to do is to signup a Broadcom account and download the VMware Fusion Pro or Workstation Pro.

After that you just choose the option:

In a few clicks you can download ARM Windows 11 and install it.
